# AHK Sripts

> There are three files in there, the Davinci file only has the davinci resolve timeline scroll script. 
> The allmyscripts file has the davinci resolve script for timeline scroll as well as a script for inducing the "ESC" key behaviour of KM player into VLC player. However that part of the script can be generalised to any app as it uses the common windows shortcuts.
